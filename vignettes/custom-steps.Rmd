Most steps run on CI systems are [already implemented](tic.html#steps) into `tic`.
The following vignette shows how new steps can be created and how `tic` defines them.
Internally, all steps are defined as [R6](https://github.com/wch/R6) classes.
A step is an environment-like (or list-like) object with named members `check`, `prepare`, and `run`.
These members should be functions that are callable without arguments.

The base class of a step that is `TicStep`.
All steps defined by tic, including the example `HelloWorld` step, use `TicStep` as the base class.
See [`steps-base.R`](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/tic/blob/master/R/steps-base.R) for the implementation.
The `step_...` functions in tic are simply the `new()` methods of the corresponding R6 class objects.
We recommend following the same pattern for your custom steps.

In the following, we describe the three methods which your derived step class must override:

### `check()`

This function should return a logical scalar.
The task will be prepared and run only if this function returns `TRUE`.
Step `ssh_add_to_known_hosts()` uses this functionality to [check](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/tic/blob/a328680ba37d7a83c98a853c00240bbcbe2b01a3/R/steps-ssh.R#L77-L78) if the environment is non-interactive and if the "id_rsa" environment variable is available.

### `prepare()`

This method will be called by `before_script()`.
It is intended to run in the `before_script` phase of the CI run.
You should install all dependent packages here, which then can be cached by the CI system.
You also may include further preparation code here.
For example `step_rcmdcheck` verifies that the R package `rcmdcheck` is installed in this [method](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/tic/blob/a328680ba37d7a83c98a853c00240bbcbe2b01a3/R/steps-rcmdcheck.R#L26-L27).

### `run()`

This method holds the commands that execute the essential calls in the end.
It is called when a new element of that step class is created, e.g. `RCMDcheck$new`.
For example, the `run()` function of class `RCMDcheck` looks as follows:

```r
run = function() {
res <- rcmdcheck::rcmdcheck(args = private$args)
  print(res)
  if (length(res$errors) > 0) {
    stopc("Errors found.")
  }
  if (private$warnings_are_errors && length(res$warnings) > 0) {
    stopc("Warnings found, and warnings_are_errors is set.")
  }
  if (private$notes_are_errors && length(res$notes) > 0) {
    stopc("Notes found, and notes_are_errors is set.")
 }
}
```
