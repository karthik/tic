# pkgdown deployment

You may optionally set the deployment to the `gh-pages` branch and then change the branch serving your site in the Github repo settings (change it to `gh-pages`).
By this you do not have all the commits from Travis in your `master` branch but your `pkgdown` site will be silently updated in the backgroud without any disturbance.
Simply set the `branch` argument to `gh-pages` and `orphan = TRUE` so that a force git push is initiated.
Now, `step_push_deploy(branch = "gh-pages", orphan = TRUE)` will deploy the resulting files of your `pkgdown` site to the 'gh-pages` branch of your repo.

# Committing single files

The `tic` function `step_push_deploy()` has the ability to only commit and push single files if they have changed in a build.
This can be very useful for conditionally pushing documentation files like `NEWS` or `man/` and `NAMESPACE` if they are automatically created via Travis.

# Running stages on conditionally

If you run multiple Travis builds on every push (e.g. if you test on multiple R versions or if you are using "build stages" on Travis (i.e. multiple builds that start sequentially after each other)), you often need to condition the `tic` stages based on environment variables.
The most common use case is the testing on multiple R versions.

Usually, `tic` initiates a code coverage testing in the `after_success` stage (see `?add_package_checks()`).
Now you do not want that this is run on every R version as the outcome will always be the same. 
Furthermore, it might trigger problems when all coverages are pushed at roughly the same time.
So, it is sufficient to just run it on one R version, e.g. "release".
When you use multiple R versions, Travis automatically sets up a build matrix with each build having [set an environmental variable for the R version](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/r/#Environment-Variables) used.
So all you need to do is to condition the stage execution on this env variable:

```r
if (Sys.getenv("TRAVIS_R_VERSION") == "release") {
  get_stage("after_success") %>%
    add_step(covr::codecov())
}
```

Setting the `after_success` stage explicitly will overwrite what `add_package_checks()` would trigger.

You may want to do the same for the deployment of the `pkgdown` site.

# Installing Github packages

While Github packages can be installed by directly specyifing them in the `.travis.yml` file, its better to do it in `tic.R`.
Sometimes the specification in `.travis.yml` is not run; this often happens when build matrices are used.
Also, you want to set the command once to trigger in on all CI-systems.
Github packages should be installed in the `install` stage:

```r
get_stage("install") %>%
  add_code_step(devtools::install_github("r-lib/rcmdcheck"))
```

# Installing CRAN packages

Sometimes you need to install CRAN packages that are not specified in the DESCRIPTION file of your package.
For example, to create a favicon in `pkgdown`, the `magick` package is required.
To install the package only if it does not exist in the cache, run the following:

```r
get_stage("install") %>%
  add_code_step(if (length(find.package("magick", quiet = TRUE)) == 0) install.packages("magick"))
```
