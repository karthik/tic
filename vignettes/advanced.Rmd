# Deployment

## pkgdown deployment

You may optionally set the deployment to the `gh-pages` branch and then change the branch serving your site in the Github repo settings (change it to `gh-pages`).
By this you do not have all the commits from Travis in your `master` branch but your `pkgdown` site will be silently updated in the backgroud without any disturbance.
Simply set the `branch` argument to `gh-pages` and `orphan = TRUE` so that a force git push is initiated.
Now, `step_push_deploy(branch = "gh-pages", orphan = TRUE)` will deploy the resulting files of your `pkgdown` site to the `gh-pages` branch of your repo.

## Committing single files

Function `step_push_deploy()` has the ability to only commit and push single files if they have changed during a CI build.
This can be very useful for conditionally pushing documentation files like `NEWS` or `man/` and `NAMESPACE` if these are automatically created via Travis.
Simply add the desired files to argument `commit_paths` in `step_push_deploy()`.

# Running stages conditionally

If you run multiple Travis builds on every push (e.g. if you test on multiple R versions or if you are using "build stages" on Travis (i.e. multiple builds that start sequentially after each other)), you often need to condition the `tic` stages based on environment variables.
The most common use case is the testing on multiple R versions.

Usually, `tic` initiates a code coverage testing in the `after_success` stage (see `?add_package_checks()`).
Now you do not want that this is run on every R version as the outcome will always be the same. 
Furthermore, it might trigger problems when all coverages are pushed at roughly the same time.
So, it is sufficient to just run it on one R version, e.g. "release".
When you use multiple R versions, Travis automatically sets up a build matrix with each build having [set an environmental variable for the R version](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/r/#Environment-Variables) used.
So all you need to do is to condition the stage execution on this env variable:

```r
if (Sys.getenv("TRAVIS_R_VERSION") == "release") {
  get_stage("after_success") %>%
    add_step(covr::codecov())
}
```

Setting the `after_success` stage explicitly will overwrite what `add_package_checks()` would trigger.

You may want to do the same for the deployment of the `pkgdown` site.

# Installing packages

## Github packages

While Github packages can be installed by directly specyifing them in the `.travis.yml` file, its better to do it in `tic.R`.
Sometimes the specification in `.travis.yml` is not run; this often happens when build matrices are used.
Also, you want to set the command once to trigger in on all CI-systems.
Github packages should be installed in the `install` stage:

```r
get_stage("install") %>%
  add_code_step(devtools::install_github("r-lib/rcmdcheck"))
```

## CRAN packages

Sometimes you need to install CRAN packages that are not specified in the DESCRIPTION file of your package.
For example, to create a favicon in `pkgdown`, the `magick` package is required.
To install the package only if it does not exist in the cache, run the following:

```r
get_stage("install") %>%
  add_code_step(if (length(find.package("magick", quiet = TRUE)) == 0) install.packages("magick"))
```

# Using Travis CI Meta-information

The `ci()` function holds valuable information about the used CI system. 
It can be used to query information that can be used for conditioning stages or steps.

For example, the user can make the deployment only to be run on Travis by using `inherits(ci(), "TravisCI")`:


```r
if (inherits(ci(), "TravisCI")) {
  get_stage("before_deploy") %>%
    add_step(step_setup_ssh())

  get_stage("deploy") %>%
    add_step(step_push_deploy())
}
```

See `?ci` for more information on which information can be extracted from this function.

# Troubleshooting: Running tic locally

You can run `tic` locally by using `load_from_file()`.
This function sources your `tic.R` file and reports eventual problems.

# Troubleshooting: Entering the CI build

If your Travis build fails and you have no clue why (error messages are too unspecific, you cannot reproduce the problem locally), you can enter into the Travis build via `ssh`.
To do so, your repository must be [opt-in](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/running-build-in-debug-mode/#enabling-debug-mode) for "ssh debugging".

Aftewards, you can call the following shell script locally by replacing `<id>` with the Travis job ID (you find it in the first lines of each build) and `<token>` with your Travis API token (you can find it in your Travis profile page).

```sh
$ curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Travis-API-Version: 3" \
  -H "Authorization: token <token>" \
  -d "{\"quiet\": true}" \
  https://api.travis-ci.com/job/$<id>/debug
```

After executing the script, the build will restart.
Wait a few minutes until the build arrives at the point when it prints you the `ssh` command you can use to log in.
It should look similar to `ssh ukjiuCEkxBBnRAe32Y8xCH0zj@ny2.tmate.io`.

Once you are in the buildm [check](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/running-build-in-debug-mode/#Things-to-do-once-you-are-inside-the-debug-VM) these handy functions to execute specific stages.
