{tic} comes with the convenience of providing YAML templates for various CI providers which remove the need of studying YAML notations of CI providers.
The provided templates aim to work for most packages that use plain R code.
Packages that rely on system libraries (such as GDAL, xml2) or link to other languages (such as Java) often need manual additions within the YAML file.

However, making manual changes to such prohibits users from simply updating to the latest upstream template that {tic} provides via `yaml_templates()` because custom user changes would be overwritten.

This often prevents users from updating to the most recent templates provided by {tic} since a manual comparison between the current template and the latest version is needed.
{tic} 0.8.0 tackles this issue: The new `update_yml()` enables updating of templates to the latest version with **user changes preserved**.

Currently this only works for GitHub Actions as this provider enables the inclusion of arbitrary custom blocks.
{tic} extracts these blocks, updates the template and then inserts the custom blocks at the correct position back into the updated template.
What may sound easy at first is in fact a very complicated task behind the scenes: indentation needs to preserved, some providers care about order and some do not accept duplicate keys.
While `update_yml()` supports GitHub Actions, Travis CI and Circle CI right now for custom environment variables and user blocks, the following rules need to be followed to ensure a smooth experience.

**Shared Rules**

- All templates need to have an *identifier* and a *revision date* in their first two lines.
- Comments of custom env vars may only span one line.
- All *custom env vars* need to have a comment (above the actual env var) which includes the term `[Custom env]`.

**GitHub Actions & Circle CI**

- All *custom blocks* need to include `[Custom block]` in their name tag, e.g. `- name: "[Custom block] Test custom user block2"`.
- Custom env vars unique to a runner need to include `[Custom matrix env var]` in their tag, e.g. `# [Custom matrix env] test`.

**Travis CI**

- There needs to be an empty line after all custom user blocks, for example:

  ```yaml
  before_install:
  # [Custom block]
  - echo 'test'

  - if [ "${TRAVIS_OS_NAME}" == "osx" ]; then brew install ccache; fi
  ```

All of these tags are used by {tic} to preserve user changes and choose the right upstream template.
During the process `update_yml()` also prints how many custom blocks and env vars were found.
If you have some in your template and nothing is printed when updating, something went wrong and you should double check your template.
In any case, it is recommended to review the changes to avoid unexpected CI failures.

The feature is beta state and issues are expected, especially for edge cases.
The internal approach is quite unrobust and highly tailored to the specific CI provider.
Please file an issue in the repo if you experience problems.

## Examples

Here are some examples for custom user blocks and custom env vars:

**GitHub Actions**

*Runner specific environment variable*

```yml
matrix:
  config:
    # use a different tic template type if you do not want to build on all listed platforms
    - { os: windows-latest, r: "release" }
    # [Custom matrix env var] test
    - { os: macOS-latest, r: "release", pkgdown: "true", test: "true" }
    - { os: macOS-latest, r: "devel" }
    - { os: ubuntu-latest, r: "release" }
```

*Environment variable*

```yml
env:
  # [Custom env]
  R_MAX_NUM_DLLS: 999
```

*Block*

```yml
- name: "[Custom block] [macOS] xquartz"
  if: runner.os == 'macOS'
  run: |
    brew cask install xquartz
```

**Travis CI**

*Environment variable*

```yml
matrix:
  include:
    - os: osx
      r: release
    - os: osx
      r: oldrel
      # [Custom env]
      env:
      - foo="test"
    - os: linux
      r: devel
```

*Block*

```yml
  - R -q -e 'tic::before_install()'
install:
  - R -q -e 'tic::install()'

  # [Custom block] block 2
  - echo 'test2'
```

**Circle CI**

*Environment variable*

```yml
environment:
  # [Custom] env var 2
  test2: "true"
```

*Block*

```yml
- run:
    name: "[Custom block] test2"
    command: |
      echo 'test2'
```

## Automating the update process

Updating {tic} YAML files can be automated further.
We provide a GitHub Actions workflow which can be used together with `tic::update_yml()` to update the templates whenever there are newer upstream versions available.
The workflow will create a branch, update the files and commit them and even open a pull request.

Just put this workflow next to `.github/workflows/main.yml` and it will silently do its job.
By default it will run over night as a CRON job.
It only runs once a day and is not being executed on push or pull request events.

Unfortunately, GitHub does not allow GHA workflow files to be updated and pushed by automatic approaches.
To make this work, the user needs to pass a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with "workflow" scopes.
This PAT need to be added as a "secret" to the repo so that it can be used within the build.
There is no way of avoiding this manual action for each repo currently.
The linked workflow searches by default for a PAT named `TIC_UPDATE`.
So if you name your secret like this, the workflow should succeed.
If you rename it differently, make sure to also change the name of the secret in the workflow.
It makes sense to memorize the PAT hash and reuse it in other repos.
