{tic} comes with the convenience of providing YAML templates for various CI providers which remove the need of diving deep into the internals of certain CI providers.
These templates work for most packages that use plain R code.
Packages that rely on system libraries (such as GDAL, xml2) or link to other languages (such as Java) often need manual additions in their YAML file.

However, making manual changes to such prohibits users from simply updating to the latest upstream template via `tic::use_*_yaml()` (where `*` is replaced with `ghactions`, `travis`, `circle`, or `appveyor`) as user defined changes would be overwritten.

This often prevents users from updating to the most recent templates provided by {tic} since a manual comparison between the current template and the latest version is needed.
Starting with {tic} 0.8.0 this issue is now partly addressed: The new `update_yml()` enables updating of templates to the latest version with **user changes preserved**.

Currently this only works for GitHub Actions as this provider enables the inclusion of arbitrary custom blocks.
{tic} extracts these blocks, updates the template and then inserts the custom blocks at the correct position back into the updated template.

To make this semi-complicated approach work in a robust way, the user needs to follow some rules when updating the template:

- All *custom blocks* need to include `[Custom]` in their name.
- All *custom env vars* need to have a comment (above the actual env var) which includes the term `[Custom]`.
  These comments may only span one line.
- All templates need to have an *identifier* and a *revision date* in their first two lines.

All of this information is used by {tic} to preserve user changes and choose the right upstream template.
During the process `update_yml()` also tells how many custom blocks and env vars were found.
If you have some in your template and nothing is printed when updating, something went wrong and you should double check your template.
In any case, it is recommended to review the changes to avoid unexpected CI failures.

The feature is still in a beta state and issues are expected, especially for edge cases.
Please file an issue in the repo if you experience problems.
Right now it is unclear if Travis CI and Circle CI will ever be supported by `update_yml()` since the R community is shifting towards GitHub Actions and adding support for Travis CI and Circle CI would be more complicated than for GitHub Actions.

## Examples

Here are some examples for custom user blocks and custom env vars:

```yml
env:
  # [Custom] Set max dll number higher
  R_MAX_NUM_DLLS: 999
```

```yml
- name: "[Custom] [macOS] xquartz"
  if: runner.os == 'macOS'
  run: |
    brew cask install xquartz
```
