You may be a bit confused about all the different packages and their specific scopes in the world of R package development.
The three packages can be arranged in the following structure, from the outer to the inner level:

usethis -> tic -> travis

The `usethis` package holds all the utility wrapper functions to simplify R package development.
From cloning a Github repo `create_from_github()` over using `roxygen2` for documentation (`use_roxygen()`) to setting up CI for your package (`use_ci()`).
The latter function effectively calls a mixture of `travis` and `tic` functions that do the work in the background. 
Most of the stuff that needs to be done for Travis is handled by the `travis` package. 
These are tasks like enabling the repo in travis-ci.org, setting up ssh deployment keys for your repo on Travis and others.

After everything is ready, `usethis` and `travis` have done their jobs and the rest of the work goes to `tic`.
By this we mean the handling of the actual CI workflow: What commands are going to be executed at all, which stage runs a specific command, how is the deployment handled.

So in summary, the three packages can be described like this:

`usethis`: Package holding utility wrapper functions to simplify R package development
`travis`: Responsible for setting up all CI related stuff and taking care of permissions
`tic`: Package to specify the CI workflow (which stages are run, which commands are used)
