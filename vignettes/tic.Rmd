# Prerequisites

If you are completely unfamiliar with the term Continuous Integration (CI), we highly recommend to read the following ressources:

- https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/ci.html
- https://juliasilge.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-travis/
- http://mahugh.com/2016/09/02/travis-ci-for-test-automation/

Now that you know that CI can help you a lot in R package development by automatically checking your package in a clean environmnent, you probably wonder what the `tic` package does do make the world even simpler.

# Initialization

The easiest way to use `tic` for CI services is to call `usethis::use_ci()`.
This will create templates for both "Travis CI" and "Appveyor" and initialize all the required authentication steps for deployment.
The `usethis` package is used because it contains various other useful `use_*` functions that simplify R package development.
The hard work in the background is actually doen by the R packages `travis` and `tic`. 
See [here](tic-usethis-travis.html) for more detailed information on how everything works together.

# Setup

### R packages

After having called `usethis::use_ci()` you will find `.travis.yml`, `appveyor.yml` and a `tic.R` file in your repo.
The default templates will trigger builds on both CI services that do the following:

- Install required dependecies of the R package
- Run `rcmdcheck::rcmdcheck()` on the package (see [here] for more details)
- Build a `pkgdown` site and deploy it to the `docs/` folder of the `master` branch
- Run a code coverage on the package and upload it to [codecov.io](https://codecov.io/)

The commands that are going to be executed in each stage of each service are specified in a centralised file `tic.R` - read [here](tic-advantages.html) for a more thorough explanation of all advantages of `tic`.

### Examples

`tic` also works with `bookdown`, `blogdown`, `rmarkdown`, `drat`, and `packagedocs`  projects. 
It can also be used to publish to `figshare`.
See the example projects below for more information.

- [tic.blogdown](https://github.com/krlmlr/tic.blogdown)
- [ŧic.bookdown](https://github.com/krlmlr/tic.bookdown)
- [tic.drat](https://github.com/krlmlr/tic.drat)
- [tic.R-package](https://github.com/krlmlr/tic.package)
- [tic.rmarkdown](https://github.com/krlmlr/tic.website)
- [tic.figshare](https://github.com/krlmlr/tic.figshare).

# Build lifecycle

## Stages

CI services run builds in stages.
Stages are ordered as follows:

- `before_install`
- `install`
- `after_install`
- `before_script`
- `script`
- `after_success`
- `after_failure`
- `before_deploy`
- `deploy`
- `after_deploy`
- `after_script`

The `after_xxx` stages are only for notifications and will not fail a build.
They are started conditionally, dependent on their name.
E.g. the `after_success` stage will only be run if there was a successfull execution of the `script` stage.
The `after_deploy` stage will only be run if there the `deploy` stage was run before.

`tic` also uses the stages approach and simply fowards all the commands that should be run in stage to the `tic.R` file where these will specified in an CI-agnostic R-like way.

```yml
before_install: 
  - R -q -e 'install.packages("remotes"); remotes::install_github("ropenscilabs/tic")
  - R -q -e 'tic::prepare_all_stages()'
install: R -q -e 'tic::install()'
after_install: R -q -e 'tic::after_install()'
before_script: R -q -e 'tic::before_script()'
script: R -q -e 'tic::script()'
after_success: R -q -e 'tic::after_success()'
after_failure: R -q -e 'tic::after_failure()'
before_deploy: R -q -e 'tic::before_deploy()'
deploy:
  provider: script
  script: R -q -e 'tic::deploy()'
  on:
    all_branches: true
after_deploy: R -q -e 'tic::after_deploy()'
after_script: R -q -e 'tic::after_script()'
```

In a nutshell, the workflow is like this:

`.travis.yml`/`appveyor.yml` -> `tic.R` -> commands to execute

The most important stage for `tic` is the `before_install` stage.
Here, `tic` gets installed and runs `prepare_all_stages()`.
This magical function makes sure that all subsequent steps can be executed, e.g. by installing required R packages.
Note however that this is not the function that takes cares of installing package dependecies.
This is triggered by the wrapper function `add_package_checks()`.
This wrapper function adds four important commands to specific stages in the build cycle:

1. A call to `utils::update.packages()` with `ask = FALSE` in the "before_install" stage (only for non-interactive CIs)

2. A call to `remotes::install_deps()` with `dependencies = TRUE` in the "install" stage

3. A `step_rcmdcheck()` in the "script" stage, using the `warnings_are_errors`, `notes_are_errors` and `args` arguments

4. A call to `covr::codecov()` in the "after_success" stage

If you specify these stages on your own in `tic.R`, the commands above will not be executed. 
So don't forget to add the commands manually to make sure that everything works!

All R packages that should be stored in the Travis cache for R packages should be either installed in the `install` or `before_install` stage.
This applies for example to Github packages.
See [here](tic-advantages.html) for details.

## Steps

Among others, the tic package defines the following steps:

- `step_hello_world`: print "Hello, World!" to the console, helps testing a tic setup
- `step_rcmdcheck`: run `R CMD check` via the _rcmdcheck_ package
- `step_run_code`: run arbitrary code, optionally run preparatory code and install dependent packages
    - `add_step(step_run_code(...))` can be abbreviated with `add_code_step(...)`
- `step_install_ssh_key`: make available a private SSH key (which has been added before to your project by [`usethis`](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis)`::use_travis_deploy()`)
- `step_test_ssh`: test the SSH connection to GitHub, helps troubleshooting deploy problems
- `step_build_pkgdown`: building package documentation via [pkgdown](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown)
- `step_push_deploy`: deploy to GitHub, with arguments:
    - `path`: which path to deploy, default: `"."`
    - `branch`: which branch to deploy to, default: `ci()$get_branch()`
    - `orphan`: should the branch consist of a single commit that contains all changes (`TRUE`), or should it be updated incrementally (`FALSE`, default)
        - You must specify a `branch` if you set `orphan = TRUE`
    - `remote_url`: the remote URL to push to, default: the URL related to the Travis run
    - `commit_message`: the commit message, will by default contain `[ci skip]` to avoid a loop, and useful information related to the CI run
    - `commit_paths`: Which path(s) to commit. Useful to only commit single files that have changed during the CI run.

# What's not covered yet?

- `SystemRequirements`: `tic` is not yet capable of automatically determing system requirements specified in DESCRIPTION files of an R package. Our plan is to automatically add an "addons: apt: " entry to `.travis.yml` that installs the required system libraries.

# Advanced
