# Prerequisites

If you are unfamiliar with the term Continuous Integration (CI), we highly recommend to read the following resources:

- https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/ci.html
- https://juliasilge.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-travis/
- http://mahugh.com/2016/09/02/travis-ci-for-test-automation/

See the ["Features" article](features.html) for a comparison with other solutions for Continuous Integration for R.


# Initialization/Setup

The easiest way to use *tic* for CI services is to call `tic::use_tic()`.
This will initialize a setup wizard which will guide you through all possibilities of the offered CI providers by _tic_.

Several yes/no questions need to be answered. 
Based on the replies we'll select specific templates.

Besides the question which CI system you want to use, you'll be asked if you want to 

- deploy from builds to Github (e.g. if you are building a pkgdown site)

- test your package on multiple R versions

```r
tic::use_tic()

→ Welcome to → tic!
This wizard will guide you through the setup process for getting started with various CI
providers.

Introduction:

tic currently comes with support for three CI providers:
● Appveyor
● Circle CI
● Travis CI

There is no need to use all of them. You can choose which one(s) you want to use, whether
you want to deploy (i.e. push from builds) and if you want to test on multiple R
versions.

We recommend the following setup:
● Appveyor: Windows
● Circle CI: Linux
● Travis CI: macOS

Selection: 2
Choosing your setup.

We'll ask you a few yes/no questions to gather your preferences.

Do you want to build on Windows (= Appveyor)? 

1: Yes
2: No

Do you want to build on macOS (= Travis CI)? 

1: Yes
2: No

Which provider do you want to use for Linux builds? 

1: Circle CI
2: Travis CI
3: None
4: All

Do you want to deploy (i.e. push from the CI build to your repo) on certain providers? If yes, which ones? 

1: Circle CI
2: Travis CI
3: No
4: All

Do you want to build on multiple R versions? (i.e. R-devel, R-release, R-oldrelease). If yes, on which platform(s)? 

1: Circle CI
2: Travis CI
3: Appveyor
4: No
5: All
```

Last, we'll add a `tic.R` file to the project root.


The deployment setup functionality comes from the _travis_ and _circle_ packages.
See the ["tic & travis" article](tic-travis.html) for more detailed information on how *tic* and *travis* work together.

# Explanation of the basic `tic.R` template

After having called `tic::use_tic()` you will find a `.travis.yml`, `.circleci/config.yml`,  `appveyor.yml` and a `tic.R` file in your repo.
Usually you do not need to touch the YAML files anymore.
All build customization are done in `tic.R` and apply to all providers.
For more information about the whole build lifecycle, check the ["Build lifecycle" article](build-lifecycle.html).

The basic `tic.R` template looks as follows:

```{r eval = FALSE}
do_package_checks()

if (ci_on_travis()) {
  do_pkgdown()
}
```

## Macros {#macros}

_tic_ builds on the "macro" idea.
Macros are essentially wrappers of a sequence of steps for often used tasks on the CI system:

- Checking a package (R CMD check)
- Building and deploying a pkgdown site
- Build and deploy a bookdown project

They can be distinguished from other functions by their `do_` prefix.
If you have a good use case for a macro, let us know by opening an [issue](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/tic/issues).

```{r eval = FALSE}
do_package_checks()
```

`do_package_checks()` adds essential steps to various stages of a CI run. 
Most importantly, it adds `step_rcmdcheck()` to the "script" stage. 
This step performs the check of an R package.
Afterwards, the code coverage is being checked using `covr::codecov()`.
See `?do_package_checks()` for more information.

```{r}
# step_install_deps() in the "install" stage, using the repos argument.
# 
# step_rcmdcheck() in the "script" stage, using the warnings_are_errors, notes_are_errors, args, and build_args arguments.
# 
# A call to covr::codecov() in the "after_success" stage (only if the codecov flag is set)
```

The other macro in the default template is `do_pkgdown()`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
if (ci_on_travis()) {
  do_pkgdown()
}
```

`do_pkgdown()` adds five steps to the build process:

```{reval = FALSE}
# step_install_deps() in the "install" stage, using the repos argument.
# 
# step_setup_ssh() in the "before_deploy" to setup the upcoming deployment (if deploy is set),
# 
# step_setup_push_deploy() in the "before_deploy" stage (if deploy is set),
# 
# step_build_pkgdown() in the "deploy" stage, forwarding all ... arguments.
# 
# step_do_push_deploy() in the "deploy" stage.
```

By default this currently happens only on Travis CI, because `ci_on_travis()` is used as a condition.
Why do we do this? Building the pkgdown site on multiple CI services has no added benefit and might even cause problems due to race conditions during deployment.

# Example projects

*tic* can be used for various R projects:

- [tic.package](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/tic.package): R packages with [_pkgdown_](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) documentation
- [tic.packagedocs](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/tic.packagedocs): R packages with [_packagedocs_](http://hafen.github.io/packagedocs/) documentation

### Blogdown

As a show case, we explain a "blogdown" project in more detail.
[`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) is an R package for publishing websites.
Under the hood, it uses the framework [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) which gets installed by the respective `tic.R` [template](https://github.com/krlmlr/tic.blogdown/blob/975aedd43fec1dd55e8348eccfca2c7c5f663006/tic.R#L5) in the "install" section:

```{r eval = FALSE}
get_stage("install") %>%
  add_code_step(blogdown::install_hugo())
```

Next the website is built and deployed.
The `blogdown::build_site()` function for websites is the equivalent to `pkgdown::build_site()` for R packages.

```{r eval = FALSE}
get_stage("deploy") %>%
    add_code_step(blogdown::build_site()) %>%
    add_step(step_push_deploy())
```

Steps and stages differ between projects (e.g. between a "blogdown" website and a "package").
*tic* is smart enough to detect your project automatically when calling `tic::use_tic()` and will add the correct template.

**Note:** Currently, publishing to https://figshare.com/ doesn't work.
Also, publishing to https://zenodo.org/ is work in progress.
